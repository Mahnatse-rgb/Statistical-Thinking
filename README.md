## Statistical-Thinking

# Assignment

# Instructions


In the next series of challenges, we will predict employee salaries from different employee characteristics (or features). We ask employees working in four different fields to state their salary and some background information.

Import the data salary.csv to a Jupyter Notebook. You will need the packages matplotlib, seaborn, pandas and statsmodels. A description of the variables is given in Salary metadata.csv.
